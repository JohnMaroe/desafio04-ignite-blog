# Ignite - #5 challenge

### Rocketseat's bootcamp fifth challenge. <br />
Here the challenge consists of starting with a almost untouched new Next application template and start configuring the blog. üü£<br />
The new technology used today was Prismic CMS, CMS (aka Content Management System) is a tool for storing and managing information for your 
site and making it easy to use in the front-end. üíú<br />
The focus was on Next's functionality: 'getStaticProps' while learning about the context of why it exists and practicing.

<br />

This has relation with JAMStack, which is a movement defending the return of responsabilities in the front-end which back-end was taking care of most of the time. <br />
The JAMStack modern architecture promises better performance, security and easier and cheaper scalability. üü™<br />
